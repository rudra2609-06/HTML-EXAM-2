HTML-EXAM-2
This repository contains the solution for "HTML-EXAM-2," a project designed to demonstrate proficiency in foundational HTML structures and the use of tables for layout.

Project Overview
The project creates a static webpage for a cryptocurrency platform, "CryptoM5." It showcases various sections common in a business website, including:

Header: Featuring the brand name, navigation links (Home, About, Feature, Contact, Login, Register), and a "Get Started" button.
Hero Section: A prominent introductory section with a catchy headline, descriptive text, and an image, inviting users to engage with the platform.
Features Section: Highlights key offerings of the platform, such as "Wallets," with corresponding icons and brief descriptions.
About Us Section: Provides more detailed information about the platform's core functionalities like "Wallets," "Trade," and "Exchange."
Traders Section: Introduces the team of traders, complete with images, names, roles, and social media links.
Skills Section: Illustrates the platform's expertise in areas like "Analysis," "Marketing," "Exchange," "Trade," and "Processing" using range inputs as visual indicators of skill levels.
Pricing Plan Section: Outlines different service tiers ("Free") with associated features and a "Get Started" call to action.
Footer: Contains copyright information and social media links.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content of the webpage.
Font Awesome: Integrated for scalable vector icons, enhancing the visual appeal of the features and social media links.
Structure
The project heavily utilizes HTML <table> elements for layout purposes. While modern web development typically favors CSS for layout (e.g., Flexbox, Grid), this project specifically demonstrates an understanding of table-based layouts, which is a fundamental concept in HTML.

Each major section of the webpage (<header>, <main>, <footer>, and within <main>: .hero, .features, .about, .traders, .skills, .price) is encapsulated within its own HTML section tag and primarily laid out using nested <table>, <tr>, and <td> tags.

How to View
To view the webpage, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
